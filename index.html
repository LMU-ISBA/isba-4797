                    <p>Creating value for the project owner/stakeholder is the project's key goal. The students should fulfill the requirements for a viable product and go beyond and above to ensure the output creates immediate and practical business value. The final product should demonstrate a deep and comprehensive understanding of the problems and provide an efficient, effective, and understandable solution to the problems. The product is expected to offer a reliable and practical solution in both technical and business aspects. The code needs to run bug-free, resilient to technical difficulties, and ready to be deployed. The product must come with the necessary documentation for deployment and further maintenance.</p>

Students are expected to follow Scrum as our project management framework and use Jira and Confluence applications to consistently plan, report, and review their progress during the project.

The presentations address the problem, its importance and potential impact, the tools and methods, the products, and business implications. Students are expected to rehearse for a smooth and professional presentation focusing on connecting and engaging their audience. Business attire is required for the final presentation. Attendance for the entire 45-minute presentation session is mandatory for the teams presenting in the session.

As such, the University expects all members of its community to act with honesty and integrity at all times, especially in their academic work.

Violations may result in academic penalties, including receiving an "F" in this course.</p>
