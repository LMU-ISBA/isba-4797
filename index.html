                    <h3>Academic Integrity Policy</h3>
                    <p>Loyola Marymount University is a community dedicated to academic excellence, student-centered education, and the Jesuit and Marymount traditions. As such, the University expects all members of its community to act with honesty and integrity at all times, especially in their academic work. Academic honesty respects the intellectual and creative work of others, flows from dedication to and pride in performing one's own best work, and is essential if true learning is to take place. It is your responsibility to make sure that your work meets the standard of academic honesty set forth in the "LMU Honor Policy and Procedures" (see <a href="http://academics.lmu.edu/honesty" target="_blank">http://academics.lmu.edu/honesty</a>)</p>
                    <p>Violations of the University's academic code include, but are not limited to possession of, or use of unauthorized materials during assignments and exams; providing information to another student; or copying the work of another person. Violations may result in academic penalties, including receiving an "F" in this course.</p>
